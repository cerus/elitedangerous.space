So, uh, I guess this is how it starts, eh?

I should probably introduce myself. I'm Cerus, a long time explorer of our wonderful galaxy. My trusty Phantom and I have travelled many lightyears and even discovered new species. Why did I start this journal? I don't really know to be honest. It all started when a good friend of mine invited me on an exploration journey using their carrier 'Catrina Muerte'. I have spent the last few months in the bubble working my ass off for a laughable amount of credits, so I immediately took him up on the offer.

The first destination of our journey were the abandoned settlements in Hawking's Gap. We landed at all four settlements and had a look at the logs that were left behind. Walking through abandoned settlements in the middle of the night was kind of scary, especially when you don't know what happened to the crew.

After the excursion I decided to explore the nearby star systems. This is also where I got the idea to start a journal. I discovered many neat plant species and lots of cool views. Unfortunately most of these pictures were taken before I knew that I was going to start a journal, so I don't have detailed descriptions for them.
